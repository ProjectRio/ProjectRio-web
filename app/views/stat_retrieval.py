## === Detailed stats ===
'''
@ Endpoint: detailed_stats
@ Description: Returns batting, pitching, fielding, and star stats on configurable levels
@ Params:
    - Game params:                  Params for /games/ (tags/users/date/etc)
    - games:             [0-x],        game ids to use. If not provided arguments for /games/ endpoint will be expected and used
    - username:          [],           users to get stats for. All users if blank
    - char_id:           [0-54],       character ids to get stats for. All charas if blank
    - by_user:           [bool],       When true stats will be grouped by user. When false, all users will be separate
    - by_char:           [bool],       When true stats will be grouped by character. When false, all characters will be separate
    - by_swing:          [bool],       When true batting stats will be organized by swing type (slap, charge, star). When false, 
                                    all swings will be combined. Only considered for swings
    - exlude_nonfair:    [bool],       Exlude foul and unknown hits from the return
    - exclude_batting:   [bool],       Do not return stats from the batting section
    - exclude_pitching:  [bool],       Do not return stats from the pitching section
    - exclude_misc:      [bool],       Do not return stats from the misc section
    - exclude_fielding:  [bool],       Do not return stats from the fielding section
@ Output:
    - Output is variable based on the "by_XXX" flags. Helper function update_detailed_stats_dict builds and updates
      the large return dict at each step

@ URL example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/detailed_stats/?username=demouser1&character=1&by_swing=1
